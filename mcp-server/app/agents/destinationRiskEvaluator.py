# Agent 3: Destination Risk Evaluator
# Model: GNN on Neo4j graph
#
# Steps:
#
#     Build trust graph
#
#     Predict node risk
#
# Scoring: score = 1 - trust_score

# import torch_geometric
# # Assume graph built from Neo4j
# score = 1 - gnn_model(receiver_node_features)
#
# #
# def train_agent3(graph):
#     # Assume graph already built externally
#     # Placeholder for GNN training
#     return graph
#
# def evaluate_agent3(graph, tx):
#     node = graph.nodes.match("Merchant", merchant_id=tx.merchant).first()
#     return 1 - node['trust_score']
