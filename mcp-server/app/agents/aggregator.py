#     updated and enhanced version of your Agent 5: Risk Aggregator,
#     now tailored to combine scores from the remaining three agentsâ€”
#     -Initiation Context Analyzer (Agent 1),
#     -Transaction History Profiler (Agent 2),
#     - and Destination Risk Evaluator (Agent 3).
#     It includes weighted scoring and SHAP-based explanation logic.
